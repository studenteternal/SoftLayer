This document is to design, set stadnards, and take note of potential feature improvments for the grab bag of scripts and other code deigned to make
life eaiser when using SoftLayer's Infrastructure as a Serice platform.

Variable naming standards. 

one letter variables should be used for locally signifigant, not re-used purposes. E.G. Loop counters

Non-API related variables should be named inb a logical fashion, with compands joined by underscores. E.G. server_id


features current

IPdemo - creates a number os servers specific in a loop

server kill - removes virtual servers.

features future 
New name for server build script. 
Pull virtual server charachteristics from a configuration file, 
	put configuration for common servers into a web resource to create a 'menu' of "approved" server configuraitons
add server meta-data to created and existing servers to avoid using names to sort server \ server role
